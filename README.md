# React rendered Resume

A ReactJS app that takes resume info in a form and renders a resume in HTML (easily exportable to PDF).

## User Stories

The set of goals that the user will be able to complete using this app.

With this app, the user can:

1. View their resume next to form data
2. Make changes to form data to live-update the resume
3. Export the resume as PDF
4. Reopening the app should allow stories 1-3 with the last updated form data

## TODOs:

~~1. Write existing resume data in a JSON file.~~
2. Pre-populate form with json data.
3. Modifying form inputs updates app state.
4. All data from form is correctly updated on the rendered resume.
5. Fix styling and rest of the issues.
